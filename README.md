With equal equity.

## Reading Order

All report content is in the directory:

* Report/

Our report should be read in the following order:

* 01 - Introduction
* 02 - Data Setup
* 03 - SGD Optimiser
* 04 - 
* 05.1 - NAG Optimiser
* 05.2 - SGD Optimiser (Momentum)
* 05.3 - ADAM Optimiser
* 06 - Comparison of Best Performers
* 07 - Alternative Architectures
* 08 - Conclusion

## Requirements

Requirements for each file are loaded and downloaded as required.
A requirements.txt file is available in the main directory, running the `01 - Data Setup` section and uncommenting the relevant highlighted cell should allow for installation of the relevant modules and specific versions if run on a blank environment

The dataset can be downloaded to the relevant section via running the code in `01 - Data Setup` but this may face some virus check issues from Google Drive, so instead the link to download the data manually is made available. If you do this, download into the data folder provided using the same `kdd_log_df.csv` name that it is saved as.

## Evidence

Our working is shown in our own directories:
