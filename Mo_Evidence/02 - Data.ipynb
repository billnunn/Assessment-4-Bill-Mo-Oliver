The pre-processing was done by the author in a previous assessment and the details of this can be found [on this GitHub repository](https://github.com/billnunn/Assessment-1-Bill-Mo)[2] under [01 - Data Setup](https://github.com/billnunn/Assessment-1-Bill-Mo/blob/main/Report/01%20-%20Data%20Setup.ipynb) in the 'Report' folder.\n",

So, while a Neural Net may not be necessary for this particular dataset, it is still appropriate for the purpose of assessing the performance and convergence rate for different optimizer choices in this setting."

    "Code below is for connection_type classification but that would need more tweaking when creating a neural network's architecture. The neural network would have to output some form of distance rather than probability of a certain type of attack, in case some attack type was not seen in training but was seen in test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the way that we split the data, we have `rootkit`, `ftp_write`, `warezmaster`,`multihop`,`spy`,`phf` attacks that exist either in the training or test data, but not in both (you can see this for yourself by un-commenting the two code cells below and running tehm). These existing in the training data alone is less of an issue but if they only exist in the test data then we may get nonesense classification of a class that we have not seen. One solution to this may be to stratify the data but as seen above when highlighting different types of attacks that exist, attacks like `phf`,`perl`, and `spy` appear less than 5 times each and so even a stratified sample won't be very representative if we are taking a 1:9 test:train split. Some selection process can be used wherein the training data has the first occurence of each connection type and then added on top of a stratified sample. That way the training data will always consist of a 90% + 23 datapoints which will always contain all connection types. This, however, assumes that our dataset is inclusive of all possible attack types, and introducing new data with new attacks would mean our model may not generalise very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model selection approach to resolve this would be to create a neural network that outputs some sort of distance from a class rather than a probability of belonging to a class, then assigning a new observation as an `other` class if its distance from all classes exceeds a certian threshold. This, however, feels like it would fall outside the scope of this assessment, and so we do not attempt it, unless we find ourselves with enough time to try this implementation.\n",
