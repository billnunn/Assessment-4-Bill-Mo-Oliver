    "    - Does NAG converge faster in number of datapoints than SGD?\n",

    "    - What DNN architecture are we using? Discuss layers/nodes etc.\n",
    "         - Could use same architecture throughout. Is this a good idea?\n",
    "             - Parameter could just be learning rate?\n",
    "         - Could use the 'best' architecture found through hyperparameter tuning/cross-validation and compare 'best' Adam to 'best' NAG to 'best' SGD. Is this too ambitious? A lot of parameters to consider.\n",

    "    - Choose an appropriate metric. ***Need to discuss this***\n",

    "    - Is dataset too clean?"
